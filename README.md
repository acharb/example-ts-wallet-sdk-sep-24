To view how the wallet-sdk can be used to create sep-24 deposits and withdrawals look at `deposit.js` and `withdraw.js`.

To see them in action you can run below:

```
$ npm i
$ npm start
```

This will run the deposit flow. At the end it will ask if you'd like to run the withdraw flow.

Progress will be logged in the terminal.

Note: the identity values used in the sep24 interactive portal can all be fake
